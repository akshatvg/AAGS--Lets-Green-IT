## Introduction
India is a country of farmers and orchards.
 
 1) Indian agriculture sector accounts for 18 per cent of India's GDP and provides employment to 50% of the country’s workforce.
 
 2) India is the world’s largest producer of pulses, rice, wheat, spices and spice products. 
 
 3) India is an agriculture based country, where more than 50% of population is dependent on agriculture. This structures the main source of income. 

 4) It is said that agriculture in India is a backbone for Indian Economy.

 5) With digital India schemes and ease of access of internet even in rural areas, internet has become a common luxury. Yet, Indian farmers are left behind in this modern era of internet. 

We at AAGS strive to change this. 

Our vision is to digitalise and modernize this industry by making the jobs of the farmers easier and providing such solutions at economical rates. Our motive is to strive to bring about a new green revolution in the Indian Argo industry using IT.
